# TCP_send_receive
Small TCP socket programming project in c lang, created for a Computer Networking course
Measure.c is the server, looking to receive a file 5 times in the default Congestion Control algoritm cubic, and then receive the same file 5 times in the reno algorithm.
Sender.c is the client, sending the file 5 times in cubic algorithm, changing the algorithm to reno then sending the file 5 times again.
